## üß© Backend Login for src/actions

### 1. App Directory Structure

Next.js uses the `app/` directory for defining routes. Each folder represents a route. Special files like `page.jsx`, `layout.jsx`, and `loading.jsx` define content, layout, and loading behavior.

---

### 2. Server vs Client Components

- **Server Components**: Default for components in `app/`. Rendered on server, more performant.
- **Client Components**: Must be marked with `"use client"` when using hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, or event listeners.

---

### 3. `useActionState` Hook

Used for form state management in React Server Components. Provides a way to handle state and errors returned from server actions.

---

### 4. Routing and Dynamic Routes

Dynamic routes are declared using brackets, e.g., `[id].jsx`. This allows route parameters to be passed via URL.

---

### 5. API Routes and Server Actions

Server actions are defined in `src/actions/`. These are functions that perform server-side logic like authentication or database CRUD operations.

---

### 6. Authentication

- `getAuthUser`: Returns logged-in user's session info.
- `logout`: Clears session and logs out user.
- Conditional rendering is based on user auth state.

---

### 7. Styling with Tailwind CSS

- Utility-first CSS framework.
- Enables rapid UI development with predefined utility classes.
- Defined in `globals.css`. 

---

## üìÇ Database Connection - `src/actions/lib/db.js`

### Purpose

This file manages the MongoDB client connection, ensuring a single reusable instance. It provides helper functions to get a database and collections from MongoDB.

### Key Components:

 - MongoClient Setup:
```
  import { MongoClient, ServerApiVersion } from "mongodb";
const client = new MongoClient(process.env.DB_URI, {
  serverApi: {
    version: ServerApiVersion.v1,
    strict: true,
    deprecationErrors: true,
  }
```

- Connects to MongoDB using the connection string from environment variable DB_URI.
    
- Uses MongoDB Server API v1 with strict and deprecation error checking enabled.

- Error Handling:

    Throws an error immediately if DB_URI is missing to prevent runtime failures.

- getDB(dbName) (async function):

- Connects the MongoDB client.

- Returns the database instance for the given database name.

- Logs a connection success message or logs errors.

- 'getCollection(collectionName)' (async function):

- Retrieves the 'next_blog_db' database.

- Returns a collection object for the specified collection name or null if DB retrieval fails.

---

### User Authentication - 'src/actions/auth.js'

### Purpose

Handles user registration, login, and logout functionality on the server side.

### Functions:

-  `register(state, formData)`
  
   - Validates form input using RegisterFormSchema.
   
   - Checks if the email already exists in the users collection.
   
   - Hashes the password with bcrypt.
   
   - Inserts the new user in the DB.
   
   - Creates a session cookie.
   
   - Redirects to /dashboard on success.
   
   - Returns validation or server errors if any.

- `login(state, formData)`

  -Validates input via LoginFormSchema.
  
    - Checks if the user exists.
    
    - Verifies password using bcrypt.
    
    - Creates session cookie.
    
    - Redirects to /dashboard on success.
    
    - Returns errors on validation failure or invalid credentials.

- `login()`
  
 - Deletes the session cookie.
   
 - Redirects to the home page (/).

---

### Validation Rules - `src/actions/lib/rules.js`

### Purpose

Defines data validation schemas for login, registration, and blog posts using Zod.

### Schemas:

  - `LoginFormSchema`

    - Requires a valid email.

    - Requires a non-empty password.

  - `RegisterFormSchema`

    - Requires valid email.

    - Password must be at least 5 characters, contain at least one letter, one number, and one special character.

    - confirmPassword must match password.

    - Custom error messages defined for each rule.

  - `BlogPostSchema`

    - Title: Required, 1-100 characters max.

    - Content: Required, non-empty.

    - Includes custom error messages.

---

### Session Management - `src/actions/lib/sessions.js`

### Purpose

Handles creation and verification of JWT-based sessions stored in HTTP-only cookies.

### Key Components:

- `encrypt(payload)`

  - Signs a JWT token with HS256 algorithm.

  - Sets issued at and expiration time of 7 days.

  - Uses a secret key from environment variable SESSION_SECRET.

- `decypt(session)`

  - Verifies the JWT token.

  - Returns the decoded payload if valid.

  - Logs error on verification failure.

- `createSession(userId)`

  - Creates a JWT session token with the userId and expiration date.

  - Sets a secure, HTTP-only cookie named "session" on the response with 7-day expiry.

---

### Get Authenticated User - `src/actions/lib/getAuthUser.js`

### Purpose

Retrieves and decrypts the currently authenticated user based on the "session" cookie.

### Function:

- `getAuthUser() (async)`

  - Reads the "session" cookie from the request headers.

  - Decrypts the JWT token to get the user info.

  - Returns the user payload or undefined if no valid session exists.
 
---

### Post Operations - `src/actions/posts.js`

  ### Purpose

  CRUD operations for blog posts, accessible only to authenticated users.

  ### Functions:

- `createPost(state, formData)`

  - Requires authenticated user.

  - Validates post title and content.

  - Inserts the post into the posts collection with reference to the user ID.

  - Redirects to /dashboard on success.

- `updatePost(state, formData)`

  - Requires authenticated user.

  - Validates updated title and content.

  - Checks if the post exists and belongs to the authenticated user.

  - Updates the post in the database.

  - Redirects to /dashboard.

- `deletePost(state, formData)`

  - Requires authenticated user.

  - Validates post ID.

  - Checks post ownership.

  - Deletes the post from the DB.

  - Triggers cache revalidation on /dashboard.

  - Redirects to /dashboard.

---

### Middleware - Route Protection -  `src/actions/middleware.js`

  ### Purpose

  Protects routes based on user authentication state.

  ### Logic:

- Defines protected routes: /dashboard, /post/create, /posts/edit/*

- Defines public routes: /login, /register

- If user tries to access a protected route without authentication, redirects to /login.

- If an authenticated user accesses a public route, redirects to /dashboard.

- Otherwise, allows the request to proceed.

- Uses    `getAuthUser()` to determine the current user from cookies.

- matcher config ensures the middleware applies to specified paths.

---

### Environment Variables - src/actions/env

### Purpose

Stores sensitive configuration variables.

```
DB_URI="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
SESSION_SECRET="random_secret_key_for_jwt"
```

- DB_URI - MongoDB connection string.

- SESSION_SECRET - Secret key used for signing and verifying JWT sessions.

## üí° My Understanding of Next.js

### What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework that enables functionalities like server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering all in one app. It offers a file-based routing system and supports API routes out of the box.

### Key Concepts I Learned:

- **App Router vs Pages Router**: In this project, I used the `App Router` which allows for improved modularity by organizing routes using folders and files like `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx`.
- **Server Components vs Client Components**: I understood how to mark components with `'use client'` when they require interactivity or state.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Learned to create pages for dynamic content using folder structures like `[slug]`.
- **Tailwind Integration**: Successfully used Tailwind CSS for responsive and fast styling without writing much custom CSS.
- **Deployment**: Understood the process of building and deploying the app using Vercel, taking advantage of automatic builds.
- **Environment Configuration**: Used `.env` files to securely handle environment-specific variables.

This experience strengthened my understanding of full-stack web development, component-based architecture, and performance optimization using frameworks like Next.js.
